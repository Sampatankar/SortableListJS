# SortableListJS
19/20: Drag &amp; Drop API - 20 VanillaJS Projects

This project is a Sortable List application that will display a scrambled list that can be sorted with drag and drop.

The project will create an ordered list of the top 10 richest people according to an API.  It will scramble list items randomly, allow a user to drag and rop an item into a different position.  There will be a button functionality to check if items are in a correct order.  The colour will change from green to red if the order goes from correct to incorrect.

This is the 19th project in Brad Traversy's 20 Web Projects with Vanilla JavaScript course on Udemy.com.

I am working through this project to revise concepts from B.Traversy's Modern JavaScript course, which I completed, and then to practice refactoring code using the React framework.
